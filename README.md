This repository contains projects related to a Discord server that I share with
my friends.

It contains several projects:

- A bot that allows you to give "karma" to other users
- A bot that posts when friends enters matches of League of Legends complete
  with post-match reports and leaderboards posted to Discord
- A front-end that contains documentation and a leaderboard
- A small website for sharing knowledge and hosting events
- A bot that plays music in Discord
