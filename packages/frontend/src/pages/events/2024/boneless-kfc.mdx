# Halal Boneless KFC

**Date & Time:** Saturday March 9th, 2024 @ 7pm

**Location:** [Jerred's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ctWz6UL4yzFPi57PA). Don't park behind a Subaru. There's plenty of street parking if there's not space at my house.

**Cost**: $9 (venmo me [@shepherdjerred](https://account.venmo.com/u/shepherdjerred))

we're going to eat chicken tenders.

[RSVP here](https://strawpoll.com/w4nWrAoPdyA) so that I make an appropriate amount. If you don't RSVP, you don't get tenders.
