**Date & Time:** Saturday January 17th, 2023 @ 6pm

**Location:** [Jerred's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ctWz6UL4yzFPi57PA). Don't park behind a Subaru. There's plenty of street parking if there's not space at my house.

**Cost**: $9 (venmo me [@shepherdjerred](https://account.venmo.com/u/shepherdjerred))

[RSVP here](https://strawpoll.com/w4nWrQ36QyA) so that I make an appropriate amount. If you don't RSVP, you don't get pizza.

## Menu

I'm expecting to make one pizza per 2 people.
