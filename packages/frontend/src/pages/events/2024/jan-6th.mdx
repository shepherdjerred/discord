# January 6th LAN Party

**Date & Time:** Friday January 6th, 2024 @ 1pm

**Location:** [Jerred's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ctWz6UL4yzFPi57PA)

[RSVP here](https://strawpoll.com/LVyK8Aw46n0) so that I know how much space we need.

Come celebrate January 6th, our favorite [national holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack). Costumes are encouraged.

I'll setup my house to have plenty of table space. We can fit ~10-14 desktops.

In the past we've played:

- League of Legends
- COD (MW2, Zombies)

We'll probably order dinner at some point.

## What to bring

- Something to play games on
  - PC/Laptop, monitor, keyboard/mouse, headset, etc.
- Snacks and drinks
