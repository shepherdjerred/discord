# Black Ops 2 Zombies

This guide will walk you through downloading Black Ops 2 and setting up the [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/) client. The Plutonium client allows you to play several Call of Duty games with support for a friends list, dedicated servers, and playing multiplayer zombies with up to eight players.

1. Download the [game files](https://files.sjer.red/games/t6.zip) (14GB).
1. Create an account on the [Plutonium forums](https://forum.plutonium.pw/register).

   Note: the username you choose here will be what you are known as in-game.

1. Unzip `t6.zip`.
1. Go into the `t6` folder that was created when unzipping.
1. Run the `plutonium` executable in the `t6` folder. This will start the Plutonium client.
1. Login to the Plutonium client using the account you created in step 2.

## In-game

Once Black Ops 2 has opened, you can press `F` to view your friends list.

You can play Zombies with others by hosting a custom game. Once you've created a custom game lobby, press `P` to open your party settings. Be sure your settings allow friends to join you. You can also modify your lobby size.

Note that you _cannot_ start a game with more than four players in the lobby. You'll have to start the lobby with no more than four players; the other players game join your game while it's in progress via the friends list. Eight-player games are only supported on maps that also support the "Grief" gamemode.
